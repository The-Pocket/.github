- 🧙 **AI systems**—where multiple AI components and external APIs interact to solve complex, real-world tasks—are increasingly vital in enterprise automation. 

- 🌈 We envision a future of **Human-AI co-design**: humans clarify objectives, while AI assists in implementing and optimizing systems.

- 🔮 Introducing **The Pocket**, a Human-AI Co-Design platform for building maintainable AI systems. It has two core components:

    - 🏭 **Pocket Flow**: a 100-line vendor-agnostic framework. Despite its minimalism, it supports widely adopted AI patterns: batched workflows, multi agents, and retrieval-augmented generation.
    
    - 🤖 **Pocket AI**: an assistant trained in best system design practices, can integrate domain-specific logic and external APIs through an enterprise knowledge base.
    
- ✨ Together, **Pocket Flow** and **Pocket AI** offer a platform for prototyping, refining, and deploying AI systems that remain adaptable, scalable, and reliable.
