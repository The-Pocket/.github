- ðŸ§™ **AI systems**â€”where multiple AI components work together to solve complex tasksâ€”are crucial for enterprise automation.
  
- ðŸŒˆ We envision a future of **Human-AI co-design**: humans clarify objectives, while AI helps build solutions.
  
- ðŸ«  Yet, current AI assistants are overwhelmed by **large, complex frameworks**.

- ðŸ”® Introducing  [**Pocket Flow**](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow): a minimal, 100-line framework supporting core AI patternsâ€”batched workflows, multi-agent orchestration, and retrieval-augmented generationâ€”so AI assistants can build on it with ease.
