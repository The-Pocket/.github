<h1 align="center">Doc is the future Code Base</h1>

Before LLM, human uses framework, who hates write low-level codes.

- Framework needs application. But

- Framework needs integrtaion support.


After LLMs:

- Code Base just core abstraction

- Adaption and integration on doc.

- Doc becomes the second code base.
